Below are the works I completed and submitted for *Research Methods & Professional Practice*.  
Each item includes a short note on what it demonstrates for assessors.

## 1) Reflective Essay 

**Title:** Reflective Essay
**Format:** PDF  
**Download:** [Reflective Essay PDF]({{ "/assets/docs/research-methods-reflection.pdf" | relative_url }})

**What this demonstrates:**
- A structured reflective narrative using the 3 W’s (**What? So what? Now what?**).
- Concrete changes to practice: **design-first** planning (RQ → assumptions → data → analysis), explicit handling of **uncertainty** (intervals/dispersion), and **intentional captions** stating data–visual mapping and the decision-relevant takeaway.
- **Ethics-in-practice** referencing Belmont/Menlo/BCS principles and how they shaped my project choices.

## 2) Literature Review 

**Title:** Literature Review — Final Submission  
**Format:** PDF  
**Download:** [Literature Review PDF]({{ "/assets/docs/literature-review.pdf" | relative_url }})

**What this demonstrates:**
- **Search & screening strategy:** databases/keywords, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and a transparent selection narrative.
- **Synthesis & critique:** grouping of themes, methodological contrasts, strength/limitation analysis, and identification of gaps.
- **Throughline to proposal:** how the evidence base narrowed my RQs, variables, and methods in the proposal.

## 3) Research Proposal — Slides

**Title:** Research Proposal — Presentation Deck (with optional transcript)  
**Format:** PDF (Slides) + PDF (Transcript, if applicable)  
**Download (Slides):** [Proposal Slides PDF]({{ "/assets/docs/research-proposal-slides.pdf" | relative_url }})
**Download (Transcript):** [Proposal Transcript PDF]({{ "/assets/docs/research-proposal-transcript.pdf" | relative_url }})

**What this demonstrates:**
- **Problem framing & RQs:** precise research questions grounded in the literature review.
- **Design-first method rationale:** data sources, sampling/participants, collection instruments, and analysis plan mapped to each RQ.
- **Validity & risk handling:** threats to validity/reliability, assumptions, limitations, and planned mitigations.
- **Ethics & governance:** consent/DP considerations, storage/retention approach, and risk–harm mitigation aligned with Belmont/Menlo.
- **Communication:** decision-ready visuals and a clear timeline/work plan.

## Integrity & provenance

- All artefacts above are **final submissions** for the Research Methods & Professional Practice module.  
- Files are stored in-repo under `/assets/docs/` for transparent version control.  
- If I revise any post-submission errata, I will append a short changelog below without replacing the original content.
