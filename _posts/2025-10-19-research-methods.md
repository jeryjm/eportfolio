description: "Learning & development e-portfolio for Research Methods & Professional Practice: artefacts, statistics exercises, proposal & LR evaluations, reflective piece, and professional skills development."

> **Module outcome**: Appraise professional/legal/ethical issues; apply principles of academic investigation; critically evaluate literature, research design & methodology; and produce/evaluate a research proposal.

---

## 1) Artefacts & Learning Activities (10% + 10%)

> This section collates all e-portfolio/reflective activities completed across the module. Where relevant, I include excerpted feedback from peers/tutor and links to source files (code, slides, transcripts).

- **Discussion forum contributions (U1–3)**  
  _Summary of my posts (aims, evidence of critical engagement) + screenshots (legible) + links to full entries._  
  **Links:** [Post A](#) · [Post B](#) · [Post C](#)

- **Literature Review (LR) – Final submission**  
  _Topic rationale, search strategy, synthesis choices, and how it guided my RQs._  
  **PDF:** [/assets/docs/literature-review.pdf](/assets/docs/literature-review.pdf)  
  **Tutor feedback snapshot:** ![](/assets/img/lr-feedback.png)  
  **Git source (if any code/tables):** https://github.com/<yourrepo>/lr

- **Research Proposal – Slides + Transcript**  
  _15-min narrated deck and transcript. Sections align to department template (background, RQs/aims, methods, ethics, analysis plan, risks/limits)._  
  **Slides (PDF):** [/assets/slides/rp-slides.pdf](/assets/slides/rp-slides.pdf)  
  **Transcript:** [/assets/docs/rp-transcript.pdf](/assets/docs/rp-transcript.pdf)

- **Meeting Notes (team/tutor)**  
  _Concise minutes: decisions, action items, due dates; attach scans or markdown notes._  
  **Notes index:** [/notes/research-methods/](/notes/research-methods/)

> _Note:_ LR structure and RQ focus follow seminar guidance on inverted-triangle synthesis and “only the best sources” principle. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## 2) Statistics Exercises (10%)

> Upload all statistics exercises (including mandatory worksheets from **Units 8 & 9**) with brief interpretation notes and any code/notebooks/spreadsheets.

| Unit | Exercise / File | Method(s) used | One-line interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | `/assets/stats/u8-descriptives.xlsx` | Descriptive stats; charts | Central tendency & spread summarized correctly. |
| 9 | `/assets/stats/u9-inferential.xlsx` | Confidence intervals; hypothesis tests | Test results support/reject H₀ with stated α. |
| n/a | (optional) Jupyter/Colab | Sampling, normality checks | Residuals approx. normal; assumptions noted. |

> _Note:_ Quantitative, descriptive, and inferential statistics are explicitly emphasised in seminar materials—use clear summaries, clean charts, and state assumptions. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## 3) Self-Evaluation of LR & Proposal (10% + 10%)

> A concise, evidence-based critique of **my Literature Review** and **Research Proposal**—what worked, what I’d change, and how feedback informed revisions.

**3.1 Literature Review – Evaluation (≈300–400 words)**  
- **Strengths:** (e.g., breadth vs. depth balance; synthesis vs. annotation; mapping to RQs)  
- **Gaps:** (e.g., recency in subdomain X, grey literature triangulation)  
- **Changes post-feedback:** (e.g., reframed sub-themes; improved inclusion/exclusion criteria)  
- **Quality signals:** keyword strategy, bias checks, and explicit “what’s not covered.” :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**3.2 Research Proposal – Evaluation (≈300–400 words)**  
- **Coherence:** RQs ↔ methods ↔ analysis plan; feasibility within ethical boundaries.  
- **Design & validity:** sampling, instruments, controls, limitations.  
- **Presentation quality:** clarity, pacing, captions, transcript completeness (as per module). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## 4) Reflective Piece (1,000 words – separate cap; Criticality 40%)

> You may write text here **or** embed a transcript + link to a video (with English subtitles).  
> Use Rolfe’s “What? So What? Now What?” (or Gibbs) to structure. Tie back to evidence above and to your professional skills matrix & action plan.

**Suggested outline (keep it tight, analytical, evidence-linked):**  
- **What (brief):** The key outcomes/critical incidents (e.g., designing RQs; selecting methods; ethics documentation).  
- **So what (analysis):** What changed in my thinking (e.g., quant vs. qual trade-offs; threats to validity; ethics under Menlo principles). Reference literature where relevant. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Now what (action):** Concrete practices I’ll carry into professional work (e.g., LR pipelines; prereg templates; reproducible stats; consent/PIS patterns).  
- **Professional impact:** Link to skills matrix deltas and SWOT → action items for next module/role.

> _Ethics cue:_ Respect, Beneficence, Justice, and Respect for Law & Public Interest (Menlo) underpin future primary data work; show how your proposal aligns (PIS/consent, GDPR, vulnerable groups). :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 5) Professional Skills Matrix + SWOT + Action Plan

**5.1 Skills Matrix (evidence-linked)**  
Attach your matrix and briefly summarise where you improved (e.g., research design literacy, statistical reasoning, academic integrity) and where you’re targeting growth next.

- **Matrix (PDF/Sheet):** `/assets/docs/skills-matrix-rmpp.pdf`  
- **Top 3 improvements:** bullet points tied to artefacts (with links).  
- **Top 3 development goals:** SMART items aligned to upcoming modules/work.

**5.2 SWOT (snapshot)**  
- **S:** e.g., clear RQs, strong synthesis discipline  
- **W:** e.g., timeboxing on analysis write-ups  
- **O:** e.g., datasets at work to trial methods  
- **T:** e.g., GDPR constraints on primary data

**5.3 Action Plan (3–5 bullets)**  
- [ ] Example: create LR “research onion” checklist & timeline for next study. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## 6) Academic Integrity & Referencing (10%)

- **Citations style used:** (e.g., UoEO Harvard / APA 7).  
- **Reference list files:** `/assets/docs/references-rmpp.bib` and `/assets/docs/references-rmpp.pdf`.  
- **Integrity statement:** originality, correct citation of tutor/peer input, and separation between personal reflections vs. quoted material.

---

## 7) Structure & Presentation (10%)

> The page is intentionally modular, scannable, and evidence-linked. Complex artefacts are moved to PDFs/Sheets with captions and one-line “why it matters” blurbs.

- Clear headings (as per assignment).  
- Legible screenshots; accessible transcripts/subtitles (if video).  
- Captions for all figures/charts; describe analysis choices for stats.  
- Branch/tag this section for submission per GitHub Pages guidance.

---

## 8) Submission Notes

- **Branch name:** `rmpp-submission-u12` (frozen post-deadline).  
- **Reflection file uploaded to portal:** `/assets/docs/reflection-1000w.pdf` (also mirrored here).  
- **E-portfolio URL in header of the submitted document.**  
- **No edits to submission branch after deadline.**
