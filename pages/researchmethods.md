# Research Methods & Professional Practice

This subject page explains **what this module is about**, **what is required in the e-portfolio**, **how my evidence maps to the criteria**, and **how I ensure academic integrity and professional ethics**.  

**[View my completed Research Methods & Professional Practice artefacts]({{ "/work/rmpp/completed/" | relative_url }})**

---

## 1) What this module covers 

- **Research mindset** for computing/IT projects: framing clear research questions (RQs), choosing appropriate methods, and justifying decisions.
- **Literature skills:** systematic search, screening, synthesis, critical appraisal, and identifying gaps.
- **Quant fundamentals:** summary measures (location/dispersion), uncertainty (intervals, percentiles), inference logic (H₀/H₁, error types), and decision-ready visualisations.
- **Ethics, governance, and professionalism:** Belmont/Menlo principles, data protection (e.g., JDPA/GDPR alignment), consent, risk and harm mitigation, reproducibility, and transparency.
- **Communication:** structured academic writing, APA referencing, and persuasive presentations for technical/non-technical stakeholders.

---

## 2) Learning outcomes 

1. **Design before methods:** clearly state the problem/RQ, assumptions, data needed, and analysis logic before selecting tools or tests.  
2. **Use evidence responsibly:** summarise data with both central tendency and spread; show uncertainty to avoid overconfidence.  
3. **Choose and defend methods:** explain *why* a method/visual fits the question (not just “because we covered it in class”).  
4. **Act ethically:** anticipate risks to people/data; document mitigations; follow consent and governance requirements.  
5. **Communicate for decisions:** every figure or section ends with a practical takeaway relevant to an informed decision maker.

## 3) E-portfolio expectations 

- **Artefacts**: Provide authentic outputs (reflection, literature work, proposal material, quant practice, ethics artefacts).  
- **Feedback trail**: Record what peers/tutors said and *how I changed the work* as a result.  
- **Reflective piece**: Use the 3 W’s — **What? So what? Now what?** — to show growth and concrete habits I will keep.  
- **Meeting notes**: Track agreements, decisions, and action items from tutorials or group sessions.  
- **Professional presentation**: Clean structure, correct APA citations, accessible documents, consistent filenames.

> On this site, I keep the homepage minimal. All **completed** items are listed on a single post page to avoid scattered links.

## 4) Assessment mapping 

| Requirement | How I provide it | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Reflective writing (3 W’s) | Narrative of change + actionable “Now what” habits | The **Completed Artefacts** post → “Reflective Essay (final)” |
| Literature work | Focused review, critique, and gap identification | (Will appear in the post page once finalised) |
| Research proposal | Slides + transcript: RQs, data/analysis plan, threats to validity, ethics | (Will appear in the post page once finalised) |
| Quant skills | Summary measures, uncertainty, inference logic, decision-ready chart | (Will appear in the post page once finalised) |
| Ethics & governance | Checklist + ethical reasoning embedded in proposal/reflection | The **Completed Artefacts** post (as relevant items are finalised) |
| Process evidence | Meeting notes/feedback and the changes made | Reflected in each artefact’s “assessor notes” section on the post page |

> I only list **completed** items on the post page. Anything “in progress” stays off the site to prevent confusion.

## 5) How I ensure academic integrity & authenticity

- **My own work**: I author all text, figures, and analysis decisions. Any collaboration/feedback is acknowledged.  
- **Citations**: I use APA; quotes are limited; paraphrases retain original meaning with citations.  
- **Data & privacy**: If live or sensitive data are used, I anonymise and document permissions; if synthetic data are used, I state how it was generated.  
- **Reproducibility**: Figures/numbers in PDFs are reproducible from saved working files; filenames encode version/date.  
- **Change log**: Commit messages and “assessor notes” in the post page identify what changed and why.

---

## 6) Visualisation & analysis standards I follow

- **Match visual to question** (comparison, distribution, relationship, part-to-whole…); avoid chartjunk.  
- **Show spread/uncertainty** (e.g., P50/P90 or intervals) alongside point estimates.  
- **Caption with intent**: every figure states the mapping (what is on each axis), the population/scope, and the single decision-relevant takeaway.  
- **Avoid pseudo-precision**: round to meaningful resolution; state assumptions.  
- **Ethical display**: no misleading axes, colours, or truncated scales unless clearly justified.

---

## 7) Ethics and data protection (how I operationalise it)

- **Belmont** (Respect, Beneficence, Justice): consent, minimise harm, equitable treatment.  
- **Menlo** (ICT-specific): consider stakeholder risks, data flows, and potential dual-use impacts.  
- **Local law readiness**: align with Jamaican Data Protection Act (JDPA) principles—lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity/confidentiality, accountability.  
- **Before collecting data** I complete: *purpose → lawful basis/consent → data minimisation → storage/retention → risk/mitigation → contact channels for DSAR/complaints.*

---

## 8) Writing & referencing 

- **Cite ideas** even when paraphrased; use quotation marks only for short, significant phrases.  
- **Reference list** matches in-text citations (no orphans).  
- **Consistent voice** and tense; avoid filler and undefined jargon; define acronyms on first use.  
- **Figures/tables** have titles, captions, and sources if adapted.  
- **Proofing**: run a grammar/style pass and a reference manager check before exporting to PDF.

---

## 9) File hygiene 

- **Stable links:** artefacts live in `assets/docs/` and figures in `assets/images/`.  
- **Filenames:** `YYYYMMDD_topic_version.ext` (e.g., `20251020_reflective-essay_v1.pdf`).  
- **PDF exports:** bookmarks enabled; fonts embedded; images at 2× for readability.  
- **Accessibility:** check contrast, add alt text to figures, and ensure logical heading order.

---

## 10) Roadmap

- Incorporate tutor feedback on the statistical interpretation section and extend the uncertainty examples.  
- Finalise the proposal transcript with explicit *threats to validity* and *mitigations* table.  
- Package quant worksheets into assessor-friendly PDFs with a short preface page each.
