# Research Methods & Professional Practice

This subject page explains **what the module covers**, **what the e-portfolio expects**, **how my evidence maps to the criteria**, and **how I ensure academic integrity and professional ethics**.

</ul>

## 1) What this module covers

- **Research mindset** for computing/IT projects: framing clear research questions (RQs), choosing appropriate methods, and justifying decisions.
- **Literature skills:** systematic search, screening, synthesis, critical appraisal, and identifying gaps.
- **Quant fundamentals:** summary measures (location/dispersion), uncertainty (intervals, percentiles), inference logic (H₀/H₁, error types), and decision-ready visualisations.
- **Ethics, governance, and professionalism:** Belmont/Menlo principles, data protection (e.g., JDPA/GDPR alignment), consent, risk & harm mitigation, reproducibility, and transparency.
- **Communication:** structured academic writing, APA referencing, and persuasive presentations for technical/non-technical stakeholders.

## 2) Learning outcomes

1. **Design before methods:** state the problem/RQ, assumptions, data needed, and analysis logic before selecting tools or tests.  
2. **Use evidence responsibly:** summarise data with both central tendency and spread; show uncertainty to avoid overconfidence.  
3. **Choose and defend methods:** explain *why* a method/visual fits the question (not just “because we covered it in class”).  
4. **Act ethically:** anticipate risks to people/data; document mitigations; follow consent and governance requirements.  
5. **Communicate for decisions:** every figure or section ends with a practical takeaway for an informed decision maker.

## 3) E-portfolio expectations

- **Artefacts:** authentic outputs (reflection, literature work, proposal material, quant practice, ethics artefacts).  
- **Feedback trail:** record what peers/tutors said and *how I changed the work* as a result.  
- **Reflective piece:** 3 W’s — **What? So what? Now what?** — with concrete habits I will keep.  
- **Meeting notes:** agreements, decisions, and action items from tutorials or group sessions.  
- **Professional presentation:** clean structure, correct APA citations, accessible docs, consistent filenames.

## 4) Assessment mapping → direct links

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="1">

| Requirement | How I provide it | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| Reflective writing | Narrative of change + actionable “Now what” habits | [Completed artefacts → Reflective Essay]({{ "/work/rmpp/completed/#1-reflective-essay" | relative_url }}) |
| Literature review | Focused review, critique, gap identification, throughline to proposal | [Completed artefacts → Literature Review]({{ "/work/rmpp/completed/#2-literature-review" | relative_url }}) |
| Research proposal | Slides (+ transcript): RQs, data/analysis plan, validity/limitations, ethics, plan | [Completed artefacts → Research Proposal]({{ "/work/rmpp/completed/#3-research-proposal--slides--transcript" | relative_url }}) |
| Quant skills | Summary measures, uncertainty, inference logic, decision-ready chart | Summarised across the three submissions |
| Ethics & governance | Checklist + embedded reasoning in reflection/proposal | Reflected in the Reflection & Proposal sections |
| Process evidence | Meeting notes/feedback and the changes made | Notes within each artefact and commit history |

## 5) Academic integrity & authenticity

- **My own work:** I author all text, figures, and analysis decisions; collaboration/feedback is acknowledged.  
- **Citations:** APA throughout; quotes minimal; paraphrases retain original meaning with citations.  
- **Data & privacy:** live/sensitive data anonymised with documented permissions; synthetic data clearly labelled.  
- **Reproducibility:** figures and numbers in PDFs come from saved working files; filenames encode version/date.  
- **Change log:** commit messages and “assessor notes” in the post identify what changed and why.

## 6) Visualisation & analysis standards

- **Match visual to question** (comparison, distribution, relationship, part-to-whole); avoid chartjunk.  
- **Show spread/uncertainty** (e.g., P50/P90 or intervals) alongside point estimates.  
- **Caption with intent:** state the mapping (axes/encodings), scope/population, and the single decision-relevant takeaway.  
- **Avoid pseudo-precision:** round sensibly; state assumptions.  
- **Ethical display:** no misleading axes/colours; justify any truncated scales.

## 7) Ethics & data protection

- **Belmont** (Respect, Beneficence, Justice) → consent, minimise harm, equitable treatment.  
- **Menlo** (ICT-specific) → stakeholder risks, data flows, dual-use impacts.  
- **JDPA alignment:** lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity/confidentiality, accountability.  
- **Before data collection:** *purpose → lawful basis/consent → minimisation → storage/retention → risk/mitigation → DSAR/complaints channels.*

## 8) Writing & referencing

- Cite ideas even when paraphrased; use quotation marks only for short, significant phrases.  
- Reference list matches in-text citations (no orphans).  
- Consistent voice and tense; define acronyms on first use; avoid filler.  
- Figures/tables titled, captioned, and sourced if adapted.  
- Proofing pass + reference manager check before exporting to PDF.
